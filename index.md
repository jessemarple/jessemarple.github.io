# About Me
Anyone that wants to learn a little bit about me should stop by here to read this first.

Foremost, I'm a __problem solver__. I love working with technology and I enjoy solving challenging problems. I am a creative architect that has built solutions - personally, and in a team. I don't believe that any one tool is a silver bullet that can be applied to all situations. 

I love to code. I love standing on the shoulders of so many giants that have build so many amazing structures that help me achieve dreams. I love the clarity that comes from mashing the keyboard; writing, testing, debugging, frustration, fixes, cleanup and commenting!

I love design and believe that as a developer I’m fairly fluent in the language of design. I know that ‘design is how it works’ and believe strongly that design should be integrated into the product development cycle at the earliest opportunity.

I love information architecture diagrams, wireframes, working prototypes, iterative development and continuous integration.

I’m a certified scrum master that __BELIEVES__ in Agile. I have seen it work wonders; not only increasing velocity of teams, but establishing better transparency and clear communication between the various stakeholders and participants. I like to think of it as a working arrangment between product owners and developers/designers.

I have lectured and taught at General Assembly, WordCamp, Leslie University and Northeastern University. Topics have included: 'iOS UI design for developers', 'UI/UX design as part of the early development process', 'wireframing',  'user-centric design', and 'The importance of information architecture in WordPress theme development'.

I am also a farmer. With chickens. :)

## Frequently Asked Questions
__Q__: Why is your github account so . . . sparse?

__A__: Well, quite a bit of my work has been with and for other people and companies. I tend to either work on public facing websites, or internal facing applications. Neither lend themselves well to open-sourcing for a variety of reasons including copyright, security and generally not wanting to tick off people that paid me to write code for them. 

__Q__: Which projects do you contribute to?

__A__: I'm contributing code to GridType, AnyoneCanSwiss and a few others at the moment. In the past, I've contributed to WordPress, jQuery and Backbone.

__Q__: Languages of choice?

__A__: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP are my primary tools but there are so many supersets that I'm interested in. 

Tools I like and use:
 
- JavaScript Frameworks: Vue, React, Backbone & Angular
- Pure JavaScript. It's amazing what can be accomplished wihtout much overhead.
- ECMA6 Promisses! YAY!
- SCSS, but sometimes LESS.
- Parse
- Firebase
- Pre-compilers: Grunt & Gulp & Webpack
- PHP Frameworks: Laravel, Phalcon, CodeIgniter and Cake (no more cake, please).
- JSP & JSTL
- Swift
- Templating: Mustache, Handlebars, & Lodash.
- WordPress and the shiny WordPress API. I don't tend to do much WP development but I can.

__Q__: Do you have any work I can look at?

__A__: Absolutely. While most of my projects are on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessemarple), here's a few that I'm especially proud of: 

- [Boston.com](http://www.boston.com)
- [Northeaster University - College of Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/)
- [The Shoes We Wore (Boston Magazine)](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/shoes/)
- [PhillyMag Design Home](http://www.phillymag.com/designhome2014/)
- [Hearing Modernity - Sawyer Seminar @ Harvard](http://hearingmodernity.org/)
- Toronto Center for Active Transportation
  - [Main Site](http://www.tcat.ca/)
  - [Active Neighbourhoods Canada](http://activeneighbourhoods.tcat.ca/)
  - [It's Your Move](http://itsyourmove.tcat.ca/)
- [BetaBoston](http://www.betaboston.com/)
- [Codiscope](https://codiscope.com/)

It's important to note that while most of these are 'public facing' websites, I also develop web applications. Unfortunately, while I could list them here, chances are you wouldn't be able to access those tools to review them. Ask me and I can share some code snippets with you.


__Q__: How can I get in touch with you?

__A__: Well, you can always hit me up through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessemarple). If that doesn't work, you can reach me at jesse @ ossium dot co.
